- Stack: Node, Nest, TypeScript, GraphQL, Postgres
- Looking for someone excited about the mission, someone that builds things, and a fullstack person.
- Matt most valuable experience to become a developer is the community.
- Gio most valuable experience at FAC is learning the process to solve problems and enjoy the process.
- Examples of the product: Minimum Viable Product - built 14 MVPs. Had brainstorming sessions each week in order to solve problems and went away to build something. One MVP is a wall of praise, someone is nominated at random and each other member gives them an anonymous piece of praise. Another is building a user manual like FAC's one.
- MH Support: Mental Health days are a thing, access to a Spill therapist. Have Spill Bank Holidays, help manages burnout. Also do 1-to-1s.
- Let go half of the team when transitioning from an app to Slack integration. The remaining members took a massive salary cut.
- Gio: When she started Spill it was fast paced, Matt helped her transition helped greatly and there was another junior at the time. Learnt through trial and error. Gabriel was a mentor at FAC and that helped her in asking questions and them knowing where she was coming from.
- Matt: Learning by doing was a good transition.
- Main qualites looking for: Desire to learn, good communication, being fine with ambigiouity.
- Won't be sticking to the same role.
- _What was more challenging the learning of the programming (FAC) or the job afterwards?_ Matt: Different feel, at Spill it would be a longer term project. Gio: Mainly job hunting was more difficult.
- _How do you measure success?_ Use OKRs, using Objectives - company to try and buy Spill, to get Key Results - 500 compainies working with. Ask for feedback after the seesions and the councillors get scored. Send user feedback to HR.
