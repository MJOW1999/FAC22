## Questions

1. What would you say is the most fun thing about working at Ticketmaster?

### Notes

- Oli was one of the first interns at Ticketmaster
- Martyn joined by Joko from FAC16
- Would be working on the fan marketplace - multi-language, multi-currency, customer facing product.
- Current products: Accessibility improvements (particularly blind people), Global web design, moving to mobile ticketing, reducing duplication of products (American and national teams).
- Core UK front end team has 5 engineers (would be primarily our role), Core UK backend has 6 engineers, Offshore FE/BE engineers, QA engineers and the Engineering lead team.
- Tech stack: React (mainly this), TypeScript (fairly recent), Next.js (fairly recent), Cypress, Redux, Storybook, testing-library, styled-components.
- Looking for candidates with some React experience, willing to learn as they go (drop us into real projects), empathetic to fans' requirements, not afraid to ask questions.
- Less pair-programming at Ticketmaster than on FAC.
- Ticket perks/ offers, day or so before - not happened lately due to COVID.
- Don't really need much context for working on a new project, etc.
- How do they keep learning a part of their daily learning? Time between tasks - e.g Joko doing a CSS course currently
- How they deal with multi-language/ time zones. JS deals with most of it, but it can be difficult working with different timezones, especially with countdowns to events, etc.
- How do they stop ticket scalping? Hard to stop bots, they work with artists to help tickets get into fans hands - e.g. fans could get a code from buying an album which would give them early access to the tour.
- Advice for applying to bigger tech companies (portfolio, gh profile), try to become an expert/ be passionate about a specific area of coding.
