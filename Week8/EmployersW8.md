### Notes

- Andy, Renata (FAC18), Azizi (FAC20) joined James today
- They are a design and build agency
- Independent and founder-owned
- 20 Staff
- Initiate, Define, Make aand Learn in their process
- They work together in cross-functional teams from beginning to end.
- Strive to foster a culture where each dev can grow and contribute to the company as a whole: through thier process, tech stack and more.
- Particularly looked at the Svelte framework over the last year and have been implementing it into big projects
- Tech stack: Go (backend), Svelte, React, Angular(past), Node.js
- Recent work: Ineos 1:59 - supporting Eliud Kichoge's attempt to run under 2 minutes - rolled out as a live event, checking which pacemakers are on the track at once
- Launching a new Paralympics site
- Working on pagesmith currently - custom poetry book builder.
- James has been as SOON\_ for 6 of the 7 years they have been running
- Rennata, joined SOON\_ as soon as she finished FAC - March 2020.
- Azizi joined December 2020 as a junior frontend developer. Doing lots of React and Svelte.
- Andy Warren - tech lead, joined 3 years ago. His role is around mentoring.
- I lost my name (book), their main client is the people that made that book
- Strive to have long term relationships with their clients
- Transition from FAC to SOON\_: Renata - felt supported straight away, already been promoted already, given a lot of time to research and do side-projects. Azizi - good onboarding process, oppurtinity to learn other things.
- Day to day learning and mentoring: familiarise yourself with some projects - give you some small UI project, and there is a code review process which is helpful, live share/collab with others. 3 monthly-review cycle to see how everything is going etc. Tech progression gameplan.
- Svelte came about as an exercise, seen that React was an issue with styling. So instead started using Svelte as there is a lower barrier to entry. They started using Svelte in newer projects rather than changing existing projects.
- Svelte is more bare bones coding with CSS and JavaScript rather than the more complicated React. Good online resources - tutorials.
- Grow and contribute to the company as a whole: Smaller contributions when you start, but bigger impacts as you go along.
- Tech catch up every week, Company catch up on a Friday (more social)
- Founder-owned:
- Why the name SOON\_: When is the website going to be live? SOON.
- How they find time to learn and what they decide to learn: Azizi is looking at JavaScript fundamentals to understanding how they work, Dan Abramov course on how your mindframe of JS helps you. Renata: constantly learning, finding something in the docs, improve something she done already, she was doing Codebar courses during FAC, etc. Andy: used to go to conferences and monthly-meetups.
- More experienced developers help with code reviews and point to resources
- Apprentice: good understanding with core web, proactive.
- Cross-functional project: Get anyone they think will be involved in the initialise phase, and its a balance of timings and other projects.
- Interogate the brief, break that down and problem solve, fairly organic.
- How do they assess how long they work wiht clients long-term: Don't decide this initially, depending on how the client likes to work.
