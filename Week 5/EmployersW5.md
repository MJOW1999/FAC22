# Joe Friel (\_Co-Founder & Full Stack Developer - **Yalla\_**)

## About

> [Yalla](https://www.yallacooperative.com/)

- **Yalla** is a collective of freelance web developers and designers, working together across the UK, Gaza and Germany. They work with charities, not-for-profits, start ups and businesses, creating digital solutions with an emphasis on driving positive social impact through everything they do.
- Small company based in London, around 6-10 members.
- They have a 3 step process when it comes to building a product: **Discovery**, **Design** and **Develop**
- **Discovery**: With their UX and UI designers they are able to work with the client to break down the problems the client is looking to solve, really understand the people the client is solving these problems for and reach initial ideas to take and test in the design phase.
- **Design**: Through wireframes, interactive prototypes and user testing, Yalla will be able to test key ideas and assumptions to ensure what you are building truly meets the problems you are looking to solve.
- **Develop**: Through short, very targeted periods of development work, we will look to build your product in the most efficient way possible, constantly bringing it back to test with your users to ensure the product is always built in a truly use-centred way.
